# PiNN lab

Material for running a lab session on atomic neural networks.

## Requirements

The lab in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), 
and is intended for running on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

To run this lab you should have a modern browser, it is recommanded to run the
labs with Chrome. You also need a Google account to use the Colab. If you prefer
not to do so, you'll need to install Jupyter notebook, Numpy and TensorFlow 2 on
your own machine.

## Before the lab

### Python and Jupyter

The lab runs on Jupyter notebooks, and you are required to do this lab by
writing Python code. You are not required to install anything on your computer, 
but if you do not know about Python or Jupyter notebooks, it's good that you
read something about them beforehand. The lab contains two notebooks to help
you to get started with Python and Jupyter notebooks, you can go through them
in advance.

In addition, here's a list of resources you can read about 

- This [tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) 
  covers Python, Numpy and Matplotlib, which also runs on Colab.
- The official documentation of [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/),
  [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html),
  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) 
  and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) include both
  introductory material and detailed information if you'd like to dive 
  deeper


### Neural networks and machine learning

During the lab we will go through the construction and usage of neural networks
are a regression tool. You will be guided to build a neural network from
scratch. However, it's better if you know something about them in advance.

Here's some material (in addition to the course) that you might be interested to
watch:

- 3Blue1Brown's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3piIntroductory) on neural networks
- A short [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5byOOHZM8) of neural networks and convolutional neural networks, from computerphile
